Developed a Python agent that interacts with SQL databases to answer user queries automatically.

Example: A user can ask “Which product sold the most last month?” and the agent runs the SQL query and returns the answer.

Technologies used: Python, SQL, Pandas, and optionally LLM for natural language query interpretation.
